## Foresight

The future of this website is based upon Website Accessibility Standards. As standards change, this webpage will continue to reflect the proper structure and implementation of semantic elements in html.

---

## Incentive

Driven by the need to display proper semantics that will allow any and everyone to navigate this page and any future web pages clearly and with meaning.

---

## Challenges

There were parts in the HTML of this website that had lots of similar lines that had to be consolidated. Also, this HTML is without any styling tags. All of the styling and positioning tags were placed in the CSS file.

---

## Reasoning

This project was built as a means to show competence in Website Accesibility with HTML semantics.

---

## Solution

If websites are not up to date with accessibility, then there could be lawsuits brought about. Not practicing Web Accessibility could result in a challenge under Title III of the ADA. Title III of the ADA does not support public accomodations that discriminate against someone on the basis of a disability. To avoid consequences, work with a developer that displays Web Accessibiity compliance.

## Take away

Web Accessibility is a vital piece of web development. It gives everyone the advantage and ability to leverage and learn the same information.
